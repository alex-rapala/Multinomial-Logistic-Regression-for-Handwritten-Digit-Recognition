# Multinomial-Logistic-Regression-for-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of a university course in non-linear optimisation. 
Its goal was to classify handwritten digits (0-9) using a multinomial logistic regression model.
The dataset is based on MNIST-style handwritten digit images.

## Methods
- Multinomial logistic regression for multi-class classification
- L2-regularized log-likelihood maximization
- Analytical gradient computation
- Quasi-Newton optimization using BFGS
- Line search with bisection method for step-size selection
- Train–test split for out-of-sample evaluation

## Results
The model achieved high in-sample accuracy and comparable out-of-sample accuracy,
indicating effective regularization and limited overfitting.

## Notes
This project was completed as part of university coursework.
The focus was on correct model formulation and optimization rather than performance tuning.
